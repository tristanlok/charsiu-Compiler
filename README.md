This is my journey towards writing a Compiler for my programming language charsiu!

I will being exploring the implementation of programming languages and creating my take with charsiu.

Taking inspiration from the 2 popular books: Writing An Interpreter In Go & Writing A Compiler In Go, both by Thorsten Ball, I hope to understand and build upon this to further my understanding of Compilers.

Instead of using Go, I will be coding this Compiler in C from scratch to further my understanding of the programming language while also challenging myself to not only understand the content of the books, but to apply to a different programming language.

Goals:

- Build a Compiler from scratch without using any external tools
- Have a strong understanding of the fundamentals of a programming language (Lexers and Parsers)

Roadmap:

- Implement charsiu --> Interpreter
- Improve upon charsiu --> Compiler
- Improvements towards charsiu --> Garbarge Collection
